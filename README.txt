The software EyeSim is required to run this coding.

Improved simulation with THREE (3) robots running simultaneously.

One robot is a Leader robot displaying a move-forward behavior and at least another TWO Follower robots that display a better follower behavior using Proportional control, i.e. the follower will move forward quickly if the robot in-front is far, but will move slowly if it is near (i.e. speed is proportional to the distance measured).
