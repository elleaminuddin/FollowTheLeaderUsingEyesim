Lab Assessment 2, LA-2 (15%)
----------------------------

This assessment is to evaluate performance for CLO2, to gauge
basic ability to program a (simulated) robot. LA-1 was also
for CLO2 which was conducted at the middle of the semester.

CLO2: Construct robotics & automation programming for practical
uses. (P4, PLO2)

================================================================
TASK:
Refer to your group work in Week 7 lab session on the
follow-the-leader robots.

Based on your work in W7, individually construct an improved
simulation that have AT LEAST THREE (3) robots running
simultaneously.

One robot is a Leader robot displaying a move-forward behavior
and at least another TWO Follower robots that display a better
follower behavior using Proportional control, i.e. the follower
will move forward quickly if the robot in-front is far, but will
move slowly if it is near (i.e. speed is proportional to the
distance measured).

Briefly describe your well-commented codes & the overall
simulation, once you have completed this task. You DO NOT NEED
to record the whole session, as required in LA-1. (P4)
==============================================================

>>> The task should take you around 45 to maximum 60 minutes
>>> to complete.

MARKS: 20 Marks
---------------
a. Leader robot: 2 marks
b. Follower robots (Proportional Control): 10 marks
c. Source files (.py, .sim): 3 marks
d. Technical explanation in short video (2-minutes): 5 marks

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
1. Create the relevant Python files, settings & program scripts
   accordingly.

2. Write your personal details in a .txt file & provide the URL
   to a 2-minutes short video of you explaning your work (showing
   your face & your whole desktop screen).

   NOTE: only record AFTER you have completed you work to describe
   your solution and show your simulation, NO NEED to record the
   whole session while you work on the solution.

3. This is an individual task, NO forms of discussions (physical
   or online/phone/messaging) is allowed.

4. Please zip all the required files in a folder; name the folder
   & zip file as: AIRA-LA-2-[matricno].zip
   (i.e. include your matric number in the folder & zip file names)

==============================================================
SUBMISSION:
- INDIVIDUAL
- ONE (1) zip file, as above
- at ULearn (if problem, e.g. ULearn closed, a Google Forms
  link will be provided later; kindly contact the Instructor)
